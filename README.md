# team-calendar

***effortlessly know*** when everyone in your team is ***available / busy***.

##Â Why?

Viewing your team's availability in a single view is
a time-consuming problem that all organizations face.

There are a few companies that have *attempted* to solve this problem
in a variety of ways, however there is no "*standard*" or *generally accepted*
solution to the problem

## What?

Team calendar sharing simplified.

## How?

Using the Google Calendar API, get the availability of all members
of a team and display them in a single intuitive view.

> **Note**: *Ask* ***lots*** *of questions as issues in this repo
 so we can evolve the requirements/solution collectively.
